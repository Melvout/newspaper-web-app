  <p class="col-6">The trip to Delaware was only supposed to last a day. David Pokora, a bespectacled University of Toronto senior with
    scraggly blond hair down to his shoulders, needed to travel south to fetch a bumper that he’d bought for his souped-up
    Volks­wagen Golf R.

    The American seller had balked at shipping to Canada, so Pokora arranged to have the part sent to a buddy, Justin May,
    who lived in Wilmington. The young men, both ardent gamers, shared a fascination with the inner workings of the Xbox;
    though they’d been chatting and collaborating for years, they’d never met in person. Pokora planned to make the
    eight-hour drive on a Friday, grab a leisurely dinner with May, then haul the metallic-blue bumper back home to
    Mississauga, Ontario, that night or early the next morning. His father offered to tag along so they could take turns
    behind the wheel of the family’s Jetta.</p>
